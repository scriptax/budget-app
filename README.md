## About the project
This is a simple Personal finance manager web app. Client side is created with React, react-router-dom and Tailwind. A RESTful API is created on  the server side using Express and Mongodb for user authentication and finance tracking data. The project is not complete (yet), but does its job at this point. Several bug fixes and improvements are needed.
